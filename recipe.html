     <h3><strong>What is Tonkotsu?</strong></h3>
     </div>
      <div class="para1"><p>
        What is tonkotsu? ‘Tonkotsu’ literally translates as pork bones. Which is an accurate description of this Japanese dish, which transforms an apparently useless pile of bones into heart-warming, lip-smackingly delicious ramen broth.
        A seemingly simple bowl of tonkotsu ramen made by a ramen expert might include six to eight sub-recipes. Ramen masters can spend significant time calculating exact salinity of the tonkotsu broth before adding more clever salt solutions, perhaps made from dried fish, and even sweetening the broth.
        However we've simplified all that to create a quick and easy tonkotsu ramen recipe that's a fantastic alternative to eating in one of Tokyo's best ramen joints. The very long cooking time and the rolling boil result in a beautifully creamy tonkotsu broth. </p>

      <h3>Method for making the tonkotsu ramen stock (8-10 hours)</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="para2">
     <ul> 
         <li>Place the chicken wings and rolled pork belly in a stock pot and cover with 4 litres of cold water. Bring to the boil. Keep a close eye on the pot for the first 20-30 minutes of cooking, move the bones around regularly, and skim off the foam rises to the surface. Set a timer to remove the pork belly after 2 1/2 hours of cooking.</li>
         <li>Meanwhile place the halved onion and garlic cut side down in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook until blackened – the bitter, caramel flavours will enhance the stock. Once there is not foam on the surface of the stockpot, add the onion and garlic with 2 tsp salt. </li>
         <li>Make your nitamago ramen eggs. </li>
         <li>Keep the stock pot on a rolling boil. Top up with boiling water as needed, as often as every half hour. The ideal cooking time is 8-10 hours. In the final couple of hours of cooking, allow the stock to reduce to half or a third (the final yield should be 1.2 litres stock), when the bones might peek out from below the surface.</li>
         <li>Remove the pork belly after 2.5 hours of cooking. Place cut-end down on a small plate, and place another plate on top with a can of beans to weigh it down. This will set it in a neat spiral for garnishing the ramen later. Leave to cool and then move to the fridge.  
        </li>
         <li>When you are ready, strain the stock. Make up to 1.2 litres with boiling water. Or if you have too much stock, reduce it further over a rolling boil until you have 1.2 litres. </li>
     </ul>
